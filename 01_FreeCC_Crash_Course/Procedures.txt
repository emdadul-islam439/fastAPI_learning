## Installation:
    * install fastAPI with -> "pip install fastAPI"
    * install Uvicorn (for server management) -> "pip install uvicorn"

## Creating First API:
    * import FastAPI 
    * create 'app' variable. in this case-> "app = FastAPI()"
    * create first end-point. in this case
        -> "@app.get('/')"
        -> def index():
    * return a json:
        ->return {'name' : 'first data'}

## Start the Uvicorn:
    * go to the project's directory by 'cd' command [other-wise the server will not start correctly]
        -> "cd 01_FreeCC_Crash_Course"
    * write "uvicorn <file-name>:<fastAPI-object-name> --reload" and the server will open-up
        -> in this case written "uvicorn myapi:app --reload"
    * after starting the server, it can be seen from the browser:
        -> go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000" [generally given into the command-prompt instruction]
    * For quitting from the server, press CTRL + C in the command-prompt
        -> if pressed the server and the Browser's data will be shut-downed
        -> can't access anything from browser
    * From the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs", yes '/docs' is added:
        -> can be tested the API like POSTMAN
